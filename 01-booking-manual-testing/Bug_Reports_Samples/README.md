# Bug Report Samples

This folder contains a small selection of representative bug reports
created during manual testing of the Booking.com web application.

The examples were selected to demonstrate different defect types and severity levels:
- Security / session handling
- Business logic validation
- UI navigation issues

All defects were originally tracked and managed in Jira.

Screenshots and video recordings were attached to the original Jira tickets and are not included here to keep the repository concise.
