# Test Case Samples

This folder contains a small set of representative manual test case examples
created to demonstrate my test design skills and documentation style.

## Why only a few test cases?
The full test suite (200+ test cases) is maintained in Jira using Zephyr Scale.
For this GitHub portfolio, I selected a limited number of cases that best
demonstrate different testing techniques.

## Included test case types
- Positive test case
- Negative test case
- Boundary test case
- End-to-End (E2E) negative test case

## Full test coverage
All test cases, test executions, and defect tracking are managed in Jira (Zephyr Scale).
