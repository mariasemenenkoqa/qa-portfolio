# Bug Report Samples — DoorDash

This folder contains a small selection of representative bug reports created during manual testing of the DoorDash **(Customer) mobile application**.

The examples were selected to demonstrate different defect types and severity levels, including:

- Address validation and delivery pin placement issues
- Checkout and cart behavior under offline or unstable network conditions
- UI state inconsistencies after error handling
- Business logic and validation gaps

All defects were originally tracked and managed in Jira.

Screenshots and video recordings were attached to the original Jira tickets and are not included here to keep the repository concise.
