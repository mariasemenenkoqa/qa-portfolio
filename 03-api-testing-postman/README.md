# API Testing — Postman

## Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates manual API testing using Postman.  
Public REST APIs were tested to practice CRUD operations, negative scenarios, and basic authorization checks.

---

## Tools
- Postman

---

## APIs Used
- JSONPlaceholder
- Fake Store API

---

## Test Scope

### API Operations
- GET (list and single resource)
- POST (create resource)
- PUT (update resource)
- DELETE (delete resource)

### Test Scenarios
- Positive scenarios
- Negative scenarios
- Status code validation
- Basic response body validation

### Authorization Testing
- Token generation
- Missing token
- Invalid token

---

## Project Artifacts
- Postman collection with all requests and test scenarios
- Screenshots of request execution and responses

---

## Notes
Some public/demo APIs used in this project do not strictly enforce authorization or input validation.  
This behavior was verified and documented as expected for demo API implementations.
